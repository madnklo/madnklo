\section{Classes}


\subsection{\texttt{SubtractionLeg}}
\label{ssec:subtractionleg}

For the purpose of the subtraction,
it is impractical to carry around the whole information
that is contained in an object of the type \texttt{base\_objects.Leg}.
A simpler object \texttt{SubtractionLeg} is therefore defined
with the following three attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{n}: an integer that indicates the leg number in the process,
	\item \texttt{pdg}: the PDG identifier which specifies the type of particle,
	\item \texttt{state}: a flag to specify if the leg
		is in the initial or in the final state.
\end{itemize}

For convenience, a class \texttt{SubtractionLegSet} which represents
a set of \texttt{SubtractionLeg}s is also implemented.
Internally, this is just a sorted \texttt{tuple} since it is assumed
that order is irrelevant.
However, this object also provides some additional useful methods.


\subsection{\texttt{SingularStructure}}
\label{ssec:singularstructure}

The \texttt{SingularStructure} class is designed to identify
unresolved regions of phase space, and by extension counterterms.
It is a recursive structure which represents a tree of \texttt{SubtractionLeg}s
in a process.
At each level, the leaves are gathered
into a \texttt{SubtractionLegSet} attribute called `\texttt{legs}'
and the \texttt{SingularStructure} that specify sub-trees are grouped
into a \texttt{list} called `\texttt{substructures}'.
There are currently three classes that inherit from \texttt{SingularStructure}
and represent different types of phase space regions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{SoftStructure} indicates that all of its sub-legs are soft,
	\item \texttt{CollStructure} indicates
		that all of its sub-legs are collinear,
	\item \texttt{BeamStructure} specifies that a leg is taken from a hadron
		beam after some splitting.
\end{itemize}
The generic parent class \texttt{SingularStructure} can be instantiated
to group together several structures and specify an additional set of legs;
this feature is exploited in the implementation of momentum mappings
to specify recoilers.

For the sake of concreteness,
a non-trivial example of \texttt{SingularStructure}
is illustrated in \cref{fig:singularstructure}.
In the conversion to a string, by default the PDGs and the state labels
of \texttt{SubtractionLeg}s are suppressed,
and \texttt{SingularStructure}s are converted to a single character
such that the object of \cref{fig:singularstructure} prints as
\begin{equation}
	\texttt{C(C(C(5,13),C(7,10,11,16)),S(4,6,8),1,9)}.
\end{equation}
The conversion of objects to characters is carried out
through the method \texttt{name}, according to the rules
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	&\texttt{SingularStructure} \to \texttt{`'}, &
	&\texttt{CollStructure} \to \texttt{`C'}, \\
	&\texttt{SoftStructure} \to \texttt{`S'}, &
	&\texttt{BeamStructure} \to \texttt{`F'}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

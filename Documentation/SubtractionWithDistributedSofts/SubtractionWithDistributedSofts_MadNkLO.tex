\section{Process $e^+e^- \to u\bar{u}d\bar{d}$}
\label{sec:uuxddx}

In this \namecref{sec:uuxddx} we consider the process
$e^+e^- \to u_1\bar{u}_2d_3\bar{d}_4$
as a double-real correction to $e^+e^- \to jj+X$,
and we attempt to construct a subtraction procedure
which features a minimal number of reduced kinematic configurations.

The elementary unresolved limits that need to be regulated are
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ee2uuxddxelem}
	C_{12}, \quad C_{34}, \quad
	C_{134}, \quad C_{234}, \quad C_{123}, \quad C_{124}, \quad
	S_{12}, \quad S_{34}.
\end{equation}
At most three of these limits have a common overlap
and need to be considered simultaneously.
Due to the lack of a tree-level diagram for $e^+e^- \to gg$,
the limit of two collinear pairs $C_{12}C_{34}$ is regular.
The maximal overlaps that we need to consider are therefore
\begin{equation}
	C_{123}S_{12}C_{12}, \quad
	C_{124}S_{12}C_{12}, \quad
	C_{134}S_{34}C_{34}, \quad
	C_{234}S_{34}C_{34}.
\end{equation}
These are all of the same type,
so it will be sufficient to consider the representative $C_{123}S_{12}C_{12}$.

In order to have a minimal number of kinematic configurations per evaluation,
all measurement functions and matrix elements within counterterms
will be evaluated for collinear reduced kinematics,
where a set of particles have been merged into a single on-shell parent
without violating overall momentum conservation.
The momentum mapping that we use to achieve this
is the rescaling mapping of ref.~\cite{Somogyi:2006da}.%
\footnote{
A generalisation of the rescaling mapping
that applies to massive particles was presented in \cite{}.
}
Counterterms that are associated to soft configurations
will be split into multiple contributions
and distributed among collinear reduced kinematics.
Within each counterterm we let the limit operation
act on the phase space volume,
i.e.\ we divide each counterterm by the jacobian $\mathcal{J}$
defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jaccanonical}
	\dd{\Phi} = \mathcal{J}\times \dd{\tilde{\Phi}}
	\prod_{C} \frac{\dd{s_C}}{2\pi} \dd{\Phi_C},
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is the full phase space,
$\tilde{\Phi}$ the reduced one,
and $C$ each merged set of particles.

In the expression for local currents
we make extensive use of the momentum fractions $z_{A,B}$
and the transverse momenta $k_{A,B}$.
Since these variables which describe unresolved kinematics
are shared by multiple counterterms,
we find it useful to discuss them here.
Given the light-like vector $n$ in the direction of $\vec{p}_{AB}$
(where $p_{AB} = p_A+p_B$)
and an arbitrary reference vector $\bar{n}$,
momentum fractions are defined by
\begin{equation}
	z_{A,B} \equiv \frac{\bar{n}\cdot p_A}{\bar{n}\cdot p_{AB}},
\end{equation}
and transverse momenta are determined via
\begin{equation}
	k_A^\mu \equiv p_A^\mu
	- \frac{\bar{n}\cdot p_A}{\bar{n}\cdot n} n^\mu
	- \frac{n \cdot p_A}{n\cdot\bar{n}} \bar{n}^\mu,
	\qquad
	k_{A,B}^\mu \equiv k_A^\mu - z_{A,B} k_{AB}^\mu.
\end{equation}
We have verified that the regularisation
of the unresolved limits \cref{eq:ee2uuxddxelem}
is not sensitive to the choice of $\bar{n}$ among the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item an arbitrary, fixed null vector $(1, \hat{z})$;
	\item the fixed, time-like total momentum $Q$ of the $e^+ e^-$ collision;
	\item a light-like vector in the anti-collinear direction,
	which is different for the collinear sets $\set{1,2}$ and $\set{1,2,3}$.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Counterterm $C_{12}$}

We subtract the limit of a $q\bar{q}$ pair going collinear using the current
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Pqq}
	C_{12}^{\mu\nu} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}} \brk[s]*{
		- g^{\mu\nu}
		+ 4 z_{1,2} z_{2,1} \frac{k_{1,2}^\mu k_{1,2}^\nu}{k_{1,2}^2}
	},
\end{equation}
which is associated to $12$-collinear kinematics.


\subsection{Counterterm $C_{123}$}

The triple-collinear counterterm for $q'\bar{q}'q$
is determined using the current \cite{Catani:1999ss}
\begin{equation}
	C_{123} = \frac{C_F T_R}{2 s_{123}^2} \brk[s]*{
		- \frac{t_{12,3}^2}{s_{12}^2}
		+ \frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} \brk*{
			\frac{4 z_{3,12} + (z_{1,23} - z_{2,13})^2}{z_{12,3}}
			+(1 - 2\eps) z_{12,3}
		}
		- (1 - 2\eps)
	},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	t_{12,3}
	\equiv 2 \frac{z_{1,23} s_{23} - z_{2,13} s_{13}}{z_{12,3}}
	+ \frac{z_{1,23} - z_{2,13}}{z_{12,3}} s_{12}.
\end{equation}
Clearly in this case we use $123$-collinear kinematics.


\subsection{Counterterm $S_{12}$}

In order to construct the $q\bar{q}$ soft counterterm,
we start from the form of the current used in \cite{Somogyi:2005xz} which reads
\begin{equation}
	\frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_i \sum_j
	\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{(12)i} s_{(12)j}}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j},
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all coloured partons of the reduced process
and includes the case $i=j$.

Before discussing partial fractioning, we observe
that the global factor $s_{12}^{-2}$ may cause the counterterm to diverge
in limits where neither $s_{12i}$ nor $s_{12j}$ go to zero.
More concretely, the contribution from the terms with $i=j$ reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qqsoftieqj}
	\frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_{i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}^2,
\end{equation}
and \emph{all} terms are divergent in the triple-collinear limit $12j$
for \emph{any} $j$.
Thus, although from \cref{eq:qqsoftieqj} one might be tempted
to assign the $i$-th term to $12i$-collinear kinematics,
every term needs to be distributed among all $12j$-collinear kinematics.
To this end, we use colour conservation to move all terms off the colour diagonal
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}^2
	= - \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}
	= - \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i} \brk[s]*{
	\frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	+ \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{(12)j}^2}
	}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
In this sense, the kinematics that we assign do not follow the divergent structure
of the invariant poles but rather the colour,
in a similar way as proposed for geometric subtraction \cite{Herzog:2018ggi}.

The complete off-diagonal soft current reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qqsoftoffdiag}
	\frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_i \sum_{j \ne i}
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{(12)i} s_{(12)j}}
		- \frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2} - \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{(12)j}^2}
	} \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
At this stage, we observe that we may replace
the invariants $s_{(12)i} = 2p_{12}\cdot p_i$ and $s_{(12)j} = 2p_{12}\cdot p_j$
in the denominator with $s_{12i}$ and $s_{12j}$ at our leisure.
Indeed, this operation modifies the counterterm by terms which are of higher order
in the double-soft limit $S_{12}$, and therefore does not spoil the cancellation
in the counterterm's defining limit.
Using the triple invariant $s_{12i}$ seems convenient
because it makes denominators naturally match the ones of the collinear counterterm
(which cannot be changed because the modification $s_{123}\to s_{(12)3}$
is \emph{not} higher-order in the triple-collinear limit).
We thus use
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qqsoftoffdiagmod}
	S_{12} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_{j \ne i}
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{12i} s_{(12)j}}
		- \frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{12i}^2} - \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{(12)j}^2}
	} \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
Whether the choice of using $s_{(12)j}$ instead of $s_{12j}$
is important elsewhere in the subtraction was not documented
and needs investigation.

It is easy to partial-fraction \cref{eq:qqsoftoffdiagmod}
into collinear kinematics.
In the present implementation we use
\begin{equation}
	1 = \frac{s_{12i}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}} + \frac{s_{12j}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}},
\end{equation}
for each term in the dipole sum which leads to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qqsoftoffdiagmodpf}
	S_{12}^{(i)} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_{j \ne i}
	\frac{s_{12j}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}}
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{12i} s_{(12)j}}
		- \frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{12i}^2} - \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{(12)j}^2}
	} \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
Possibly in the future we may want to change the partial fractions
to be dependent only on angles and not on energies:
in the case of two collinear pairs with distributed single-soft limits,
this has been noted to be essential for disjoint collinear limits to work
in combination with distributed soft subtraction.


\subsection{Counterterm $C_{123}S_{12}$}

Shifting out of the diagonal the sum over colour dipoles for the $q\bar{q}$ soft limit
turns out to be extremely practical also to take its $C_{123}$ triple-collinear limit.
We start with either \cref{eq:qqsoftoffdiagmod} or \cref{eq:qqsoftoffdiagmodpf}
(the partial fraction makes no difference in the $C_{123}$ limit), and observe that
for a given term to contribute one of $i$ or $j$ needs to be equal to $3$,
and in the collinear limit the ratio of scalar products with another leg
is equal to a ratio of momentum fractions.
After this replacement, colour conservation can be used and we find
\begin{equation}
	C_{123}S_{12} = - \frac{2T_R}{s_{12}^2} \colorT{3}^2
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{13} z_{2,13} + s_{23} z_{1,23} - s_{12} z_{3,12}}
		{s_{123} z_{12,3}}
		- \frac{s_{13}s_{23}}{s_{123}^2} - \frac{z_{1,23} z_{2,13}}{z_{12,3}^2}
	}.
\end{equation}
Note that, if the contributions on the diagonal have not been reshuffled,
some effort is needed to see that the latter two terms are needed.
We also note that subtracting this sub-limit from $C_{123}$
many terms simplify and we are left with
\begin{equation}
	C_{123} - C_{123}S_{12} = \frac{C_F T_R}{s_{123}^2} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} \frac{z_{1,23}^2 + z_{2,13}^2}{z_{12,3}} - 1
		+ \eps \brk*{1 + \frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} z_{12,3} }
	},
\end{equation}
which is what is currently implemented in the code (for $\eps=0$).
This hard triple-collinear counterterm is clearly associated
to $123$-collinear kinematics, and for the simplifications to occur
the momentum fractions have to be computed as in $C_{123}$.


\subsection{Counterterm $C_{123}C_{12}$}

The strong-ordered collinear limit $C_{123}C_{12}$ is the first nested limit
that we encounter whose counterterm we implement in an iterated fashion.
To this end we follow the steps of \cite{Somogyi:2006da}.
Starting from the counterterm $C_{12}$, we take the extra collinear limit
of the parent gluon $\mpd{12}$ of the quark-antiquark pair
going collinear to the mapped, different-species quark $\mpd{3}$.
This involves taking the collinear limit of a spin-correlated matrix element,
which gives the splitting function
\begin{equation}
	C_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}^{\alpha\beta,ss'} = \frac{C_F}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}}
	\delta_{ss'} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}}{2} d^{\alpha\beta}
		- 2 \frac{z_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}}{z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}}
		\frac{k_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}^\alpha k_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}^\beta}
		{k_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}^2}
	}.
\end{equation}
The sum over physical polarisations is given by the transverse tensor
with respect to the light-cone vector in the collinear direction $p$
and a reference null vector $n$,
\begin{equation}
	d^{\alpha\beta}(p, n) \equiv
	-g^{\alpha\beta}
	+ \frac{p^\alpha n^\beta + p^\beta n^\alpha}{p \cdot n}.
\end{equation}
We have indicated with a hat the variables which are computed
after merging particles 1 and 2.
Performing the Lorentz algebra we find
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:iterC123C12qq}
	C_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}^{\alpha\beta,ss'} C_{12,\alpha\beta}
	= \frac{C_FT_R}{s_{12}s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}} \delta^{ss'} \brk[s]3{
		\brk3{
			2 \frac{z_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}}{z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}}+
			z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}} (1 - \eps)
		} - 2 z_{1,2} z_{2,1} \brk3{
			z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}} +
			\frac{z_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}}{z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}}
			\frac{(2k_{1,2}\cdot k_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}})^2}
			{k_{1,2}^2 k_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}^2}
		}
	}.
\end{equation}
The reduced matrix element is evaluated for momenta that have been obtained
merging particles 1, 2 and 3 with a generalised rescaling mapping.
This is equivalent to merging 1 and 2 into $\mpd{12}$
recoiling against all other legs,
and later merging $\mpd{12}$ with $\mpd{3}$
recoiling against all remaining momenta.


\subsection{Counterterm $S_{12}C_{12}$}

The limit where the $q\bar{q}$ pair is both collinear and soft is over-subtracted
and needs to be added back.
The corresponding counter-counterterm $S_{12}C_{12}$
may also be constructed iteratively as done in \cite{Somogyi:2005xz}.
After the $C_{12}$ limit has been taken the reduced, spin-correlated matrix element 
which contains the single parent $\mpd{12}$ in the limit of soft $\mpd{12}$
factorises with the current
\begin{equation}
	S_{\mpd{12}}^{\mu\nu}
	= \sum_{i, j}
	\frac{\mpd{p}_i^\mu \mpd{p}_j^\nu + \mpd{p}_i^\nu \mpd{p}_j^\mu}
	{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}} s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}
	2\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}

Since this current multiplies the splitting function for the 12-collinear limit
which features a factor $s_{12}^{-1}$,
the counterterm is divergent in all triple-collinear configurations
and not just in the $12i$- or $12j$-collinear limits.
Similarly to the case of $S_{12}$, it is thus convenient
to shift away the elements on the colour diagonal using colour conservation,
which gives
\begin{equation}
	S_{\mpd{12}}^{\mu\nu}
	= \sum_{i \ne j} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{\mpd{p}_i^\mu \mpd{p}_j^\nu + \mpd{p}_i^\nu \mpd{p}_j^\mu}
		{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}} s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}
		- \frac{\mpd{p}_i^\mu \mpd{p}_i^\nu}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}}^2}
		- \frac{\mpd{p}_j^\mu \mpd{p}_j^\nu}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}^2}
	} 2 \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
Contracting this expression with \cref{eq:Pqq},
with the assumption that $\mpd{p}_i$ and $\mpd{p}_j$
be massless, we find
\begin{multline}
\label{eq:S12C12iter}
	S_{12}^{\mu\nu} C_{12,\mu\nu}
	= \frac{T_R}{s_{12}} \sum_{i \ne j} \bigg[
		- \frac{s_{\mpd{i}\mpd{j}}}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}}s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}
		+ 2 z_{1,2} z_{2,1}
		\frac{(2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_i)(2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_j)}
		{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}} s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}} k_{1,2}^2}
		\\\times
		\brk3{ 1
		- \frac{1}{2} \frac{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}}}
		\frac{2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_i}{2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_j}
		- \frac{1}{2} \frac{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}}}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}
		\frac{2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_j}{2k_{1,2}\cdot\mpd{p}_i}
		}
	\bigg] \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{multline}

At this stage, the $S_{12}C_{12}$ counterterm may be partial-fractioned
into triple-collinear sectors following the colour structure.
We choose to perform this operation \emph{after} the limit $C_{12}$
has been taken, as if we were dealing with a single-soft gluon $\mpd{12}$.%
\footnote{
This choice might match better the structure of iterated limits,
such that $S_{12}C_{12}$ regulates the $C_{12}$ integrated counterterm
in the $S_{\mpd{12}}$ single-unresolved limit
within the single-unresolved phase space.
However the specific form of partial fraction employed
may have interplay with other subtraction elements
and deserves further investigation.
}
We thus use the current
\begin{equation}
	S_{12}^{(i),\mu\nu} C_{12,\mu\nu}
	= \frac{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}{s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{i}}+s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{j}}}
	S_{12}^{\mu\nu} C_{12,\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
within $12i$ triple-collinear kinematics.

This, however, is not sufficient to achieve
the desired cancellation pattern.
Indeed, when the counterterm built from the current \labelcref{eq:S12C12iter}
is included with $12k$ collinear kinematics for some $k$,
which clearly reduce to no momentum mapping for soft $p_{12}$,
it does \emph{not} automatically match
the counterterm $C_{12}$ from \cref{eq:Pqq} in the $S_{12}$ limit.
This is due to our choice of dividing by the jacobian factor
of \cref{eq:jaccanonical} which, in the $S_{12}$ limit,
is different between the mappings that merge
the sets $\set{1,2}$ and $\set{1,2,3}$.
To fix this mismatch we have two options.
The first one, which essentially follows \cite{Somogyi:2006da},
is to forfeit \cref{eq:jaccanonical} and divide by jacobians
which are defined by the alternative
canonical factorisation of phase space
\begin{equation}
	\dd{\Phi} = \mathcal{J}\times \dd{\tilde{\Phi}}
	\prod_{C} \frac{\dd{\alpha_C}}{2\pi} \dd{\Phi_C},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_C$ are the parameters of the rescaling mapping
defined in \cite{Somogyi:2006da}.
Given that $\alpha_C$ is essentially the light-cone component
of the momentum of the collinear set in the anti-collinear direction,
i.e.\ its `minus' component,
this choice amounts to parametrise the virtuality variables
with the anti-collinear components of the collinear momenta.
The second possibility is to reabsorb the mismatch factor
into the definition of the counterterm, replacing for instance
\begin{equation}
	S_{12}^{(i),\mu\nu} C_{12,\mu\nu}
	\to \frac{Q\cdot p_{12}}{Q\cdot p_{\mpd{12}}}
	S_{12}^{(i),\mu\nu} C_{12,\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
Note that the factor is only defined up to terms
which are higher-order in the $S_{12}$ limit,
with the constraint that it goes to 1
in the $C_{12}$ and $C_{123}$ limits.
At the moment it does not seem clear which option
is the most convenient, but it is relatively easy
to switch between the two.%
\footnote{
Within \texttt{MadNkLO}, the first option can be chosen
by selecting \texttt{alpha\_jacobian} as \texttt{factor}
for the currents, either individually
or globally in \texttt{QCD\_local\_currents.py}
(beware that this might affect other schemes).
The mismatch factor is instead implemented
within the \texttt{ee2qqgg-NNLO-IR-limits} branch
in the \texttt{cataniseymour} NNLO local current
\texttt{QCD\_final\_collinear\_0\_QQxq},
and more precisely in the method \texttt{S12C12\_kernel}
with the variable \texttt{fix}.
}

\begin{comment}
A potential drawback of this choice is that
it makes the subtraction of disjoint collinear limits more complicated.
In fact, within the formula
\begin{equation}
	1
	- C_{12} - C_{34}
	+ C_{\mpd{3}\mpd{4}} C_{12} + C_{\mpd{1}\mpd{2}} C_{34}
	- C_{12;34},
\end{equation}
the last three terms, which all feature the same kinematics
thanks to the commutativity property of the rescaling mapping,
now differ \emph{only} because of jacobian factors.	
\end{comment}


\subsection{Counterterm $S_{12}C_{123}C_{12}$}

The last piece that is missing for the three limits
$S_{12}$, $C_{123}$ and $C_{12}$ to be regulated is the triple overlap,
which has been subtracted three times in the simple counterterms
and added back three times in the double overlaps,
so that it still needs to be subtracted from the original integrand.
The singular current, which is constructed to match \cite{Somogyi:2006da},
can be obtained from \cref{eq:iterC123C12qq} dropping terms
which do not have a $z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}$ denominator%
\footnote{
In performing this step we somewhat arbitrarily decide
to keep the $z_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}$ terms at the numerator
which theoretically could or should be set to one.
Very roughly speaking this is equivalent to taking
the $C_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}$ limit of the soft counterterm for $S_{\mpd{12}}$,
as it is sometimes useful to do for single-unresolved
nested soft-collinear limits.
}
\begin{equation}
	S_{\mpd{12}} C_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}} C_{12}
	= \frac{2 C_F T_R}{s_{12}s_{\mpd{12}\mpd{3}}}
	\frac{z_{\mpd{3},\mpd{12}}}{z_{\mpd{12},\mpd{3}}}
	\brk[s]3{

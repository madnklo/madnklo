\section{Counterterms}

For the process $e^+e^- \to u_1\bar{u}_2d_3\bar{d}_4$
as a real correction to $e^+e^- \to jj+X$,
the elementary limits that need to be regulated are
\begin{equation}
	C_{12}, \quad C_{34}, \quad
	C_{134}, \quad C_{234}, \quad C_{123}, \quad C_{124}, \quad
	S_{12}, \quad S_{34}.
\end{equation}
At most three of these limits have a common overlap
and need to be considered simultaneously.
Due to the lack of a tree-level diagram for $e^+e^- \to gg$,
the limit of two collinear pairs $C_{12}C_{34}$ is regular.
The maximal overlaps that we need to consider are therefore
\begin{equation}
	C_{123}S_{12}C_{12}, \quad
	C_{124}S_{12}C_{12}, \quad
	C_{134}S_{34}C_{34}, \quad
	C_{234}S_{34}C_{34}.
\end{equation}
These are all of the same type,
so it will be sufficient to consider the representative $C_{123}S_{12}C_{12}$.

\subsection{C(1,2)}
We subtract the limit of a $q\bar{q}$ pair going collinear using the current
\begin{equation}
	C_{12}^{\mu\nu} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}} \brk[s]*{
		- g^{\mu\nu}
		+ 4 z_{1,2} z_{2,1} \frac{k_{1,2}^\mu k_{1,2}^\nu}{k_{1,2}^2}
	},
\end{equation}
in combination with the generalised rescaling mapping
and ? variables.

\subsection{C(1,2,3)}

The triple-collinear counterterm for $q'\bar{q}'q$
is determined using the current \cite{Catani:1999ss}
\begin{equation}
	C_{123} = \frac{C_F T_R}{2 s_{123}^2} \brk[s]*{
		- \frac{t_{12,3}^2}{s_{12}^2}
		+ \frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} \brk*{
			\frac{4 z_{3,12} + (z_{1,23} - z_{2,13})^2}{z_{12,3}}
			+(1 - 2\eps) z_{12,3}
		}
		- (1 - 2\eps)
	},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	t_{12,3}
	\equiv 2 \frac{z_{1,23} s_{23} - z_{2,13} s_{13}}{z_{12,3}}
	+ \frac{z_{1,23} - z_{2,13}}{z_{12,3}} s_{12}.
\end{equation}
Once more we use ? variables and the generalised rescaling mapping.


\subsection{S(1,2)}

In order to construct the $q\bar{q}$ soft counterterm,
we start from the form of the current used in \cite{Somogyi:2005xz} which reads
\begin{equation}
	\frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_i \sum_j
	\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{(12)i} s_{(12)j}}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j},
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all coloured partons of the reduced process
and includes the case $i=j$.
Before discussing partial fractioning, we carry out two modifications.

The first one, which may be inessential, is the replacement of
the invariants $s_{(12)i} = 2p_{12}\cdot p_i$ and $s_{(12)j} = 2p_{12}\cdot p_j$
in the denominator with $s_{12i}$ and $s_{12j}$.
This operation modifies the counterterm by terms which are of higher order
in the double-soft limit $S_{12}$, and therefore does not spoil the cancellation
in the counterterm's defining limit.
Using the triple invariants $s_{12i}$ and $s_{12j}$ seems convenient
because they make denominators naturally match the ones of collinear counterterms
(which cannot be changed because the modification $s_{123}\to s_{(12)3}$
is \emph{not} higher-order in the triple-collinear limit).

The second modification is more important, and is related to the fact
that the global factor $s_{12}^{-2}$ may cause the counterterm to diverge
in limits which do not require either $s_{12i}$ nor $s_{12j}$ to go to zero.
More concretely, the contribution from the terms with $i=j$ reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qqsoftieqj}
	\frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_{i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}^2,
\end{equation}
and \emph{all} terms are divergent in the triple-collinear limit $12j$
for \emph{any} $j$.
Thus, although from \cref{eq:qqsoftieqj} one might be tempted
to assign the $i$-th term to $12i$-collinear kinematics,
every term needs to be distributed among all $12j$-collinear kinematics.
To this end, we use colour conservation to move all terms off the diagonal
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}^2
	= - \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i}
	\frac{2s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}
	= - \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i} \brk[s]*{
	\frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{(12)i}^2}
	+ \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{(12)j}^2}
	}
	\colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
In this sense, the kinematics that we assign do not follow the divergent structure
of the invariant poles but rather the colour,
in a similar way as proposed for geometric subtraction \cite{Herzog:2018ggi}.

Our complete soft currents thus reads
\begin{equation}
	S_{12} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_i \sum_{j \ne i}
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{12i} s_{12j}}
		- \frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{12i}^2} - \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{12j}^2}
	} \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
It is easy to partial-fraction this expression into collinear kinematics;
in the present implementation we use
\begin{equation}
	1 = \frac{s_{12i}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}} + \frac{s_{12j}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}},
\end{equation}
for each term in the dipole sum, which leads to
\begin{equation}
	S_{12}^{(i)} = \frac{T_R}{s_{12}^2} \sum_{j \ne i}
	\frac{s_{12i}}{s_{12i} + s_{12j}}
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{1i}s_{2j} + s_{1j}s_{2i} - s_{12}s_{ij}}{s_{12i} s_{12j}}
		- \frac{s_{1i}s_{2i}}{s_{12i}^2} - \frac{s_{1j}s_{2j}}{s_{12j}^2}
	} \colorT{i}\cdot\colorT{j}.
\end{equation}
Possibly in the future we may want to change the partial fractions
to be dependent only on angles and not on energies:
in the case of two collinear pairs with distributed single-soft limits,
this has been noted to be essential for disjoint collinear limits to work
in combination with distributed soft subtraction.


\subsection{C(S(1,2),3)}

Shifting out of the diagonal the sum over colour dipoles for the $q\bar{q}$ soft limit
turns out to be extremely practical also to take its $C_{123}$ triple-collinear limit.
Indeed it is sufficient to note that for a given term to contribute one of $i$ or $j$
needs to be equal to $3$, and that in the collinear limit
the ratio of scalar products with another leg
is equal to a ratio of momentum fractions.
After this replacement colour conservation can be used and we find
\begin{equation}
	C_{123}S_{12} = - \frac{2T_R}{s_{12}^2} \colorT{3}^2
	\brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{13} z_{2,13} + s_{23} z_{1,23} - s_{12} z_{3,12}}
		{s_{123} z_{12,3}}
		- \frac{s_{13}s_{23}}{s_{123}^2} - \frac{z_{1,23} z_{2,13}}{z_{12,3}^2}
	}.
\end{equation}
Note that, if the contributions on the diagonal have not been reshuffled,
some effort is needed to see that the latter two terms are needed.
We also note that subtracting this sub-limit from $C_{123}$
many terms simplify and we are left with
\begin{equation}
	C_{123} - C_{123}S_{12} = \frac{C_F T_R}{s_{123}^2} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} \frac{z_1^2 + z_2^2}{z_1+z_2} - 1
		+ \eps \brk*{1 + \frac{s_{123}}{s_{12}} (z_1+z_2) }
	},
\end{equation}
which is what is currently implemented in the code (admittedly with $\eps=0$).
This hard triple-collinear counterterm is clearly associated
to $123$-collinear kinematics, and for the simplifications to occur
the momentum fractions have to be computed as in $C_{123}$.


\subsection{C(C(1,2),3)}

\begin{equation}
	\Pi^{\alpha\beta}(p, n) =
	-g^{\alpha\beta}
	+ \frac{p^\alpha n^\beta + p^\beta n^\alpha}{p \cdot n},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	C_{(12)3}^{\alpha\beta,ss'} = \frac{C_F}{s_{123}}
	\delta_{ss'} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{z_{12,3}}{2} \Pi^{\alpha\beta}
		- 2 \frac{z_{3,12}}{z_{12,3}}
		\frac{k_{3,12}^\alpha k_{3,12}^\beta}{k_{3,12}^2}
	}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	-g_{\alpha\beta} \Pi^{\alpha\beta}
	= (\dim-2) - 2
	= - 2 \eps
\end{equation}
\begin{multline}
	C_{(12)3}^{\alpha\beta,ss'} C_{12,\alpha\beta}
	= \frac{C_FT_R}{s_{12}s_{123}} \bigg[
		- z_{12,3} \brk*{\eps + 2 z_{1,2} z_{2,1} + \text{gauge terms?}}
		\\
		+ 2 \frac{z_{3,12}}{z_{1,23}} \brk3{
			1 - z_{1,2} z_{2,1}
			\frac{(2k_{1,2}\cdot k_{3,12})^2}{k_{1,2}^2 k_{3,12}^2}

	\colorT{j}\cdot\colorT{k}
	= \sum_{(j,k) \ne 1, 2} \brk[s]*{
		\frac{p_j^\mu p_k^\nu + p_j^\nu p_k^\mu}{s_{12j} s_{12k}}

		- \frac{s_{j\perp}^2}{s_{12j}^2 n_\perp^2}
		- \frac{s_{k\perp}^2}{s_{12k}^2 n_\perp^2}
		}
	} \colorT{j}\cdot\colorT{k},

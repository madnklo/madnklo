*********************
TODO 21/03

 - *done* create file.inc from exporter and sectors.py in an ‘include’ directory for each real subprocesses

 - *done* merge common files.f 

 - *done* define in nlo_Rsub the association iu,is,ib,ia = isec,jsec,iref,ia

 - add in makefile the command compiling the libdhelas/libmodel 

 - driver and nlo_Rsub need to know:  mur, scm, nit, ncall (read from card)

 - move common files.f in Source directory through exporter  

 - generalise makefile to all sectors

 - create makefile from exporter

*********************
28/03
- generation of param_card.inc and run_card.inc (still to be checked)
- modified math.inc: removed call to mur -> mu_r, asmz -> as, nloop (maybe) not set by param_card
- in driver and other file added: coupl/input/run/cuts.inc (*)
- added lines CALL SETPARA('param_card.dat'), CALL SETRUN('run_card.dat') in driver
- added sCM in NLO_Rsub + various include files in (*)
- reduced run_card.inc parameter to include just ebeam so far
- still necessary to define vegas parameters nitr,nclr (handled in launch phase in python)
- nloop set harcoded in math.inc
- added setrun.f in subprocess directory 

*********************
TODO Meeting 29/03

- import in Template/TorinoNLO the run_card.dat from NLO template, cuts.inc

- copy in Template/TorinoNLO/ the setrun.f version of test_eejj/Source (with necessary commented lines)

- remove current param/run_card.inc generation from export_ME7.py and create a 'treatcards' python file
  in Template/TorinoNLO/bin to be called before the integration in the makefile, as 
  		../bin/treatcards treatcards all  
  so as to always have their updated version;

- check that setrun.f and all include files from Source are removed from P_blabla/include directory; 

- modify makefile in Source to create libgeneric; create symlink for libgeneric to test_eejj/lib at the exporter level;
  (maybe also for libpdf.a);

- modify tmp_fortran/tmp_files/makefile to test_eejj version

- update templates for driver/NLO_Rsub/NLO_IR_limits to test_eejj version



*********************
TODO 30/03

- fix writing of makefile in sectors.py (it seems to import the same for every subprocess directory!)

- take care of changes in Source/makefile and setrun.f for generating libgeneric in Source (working one in test_eejj)

- import in Template/TorinoNLO the run_card.dat from NLO template and associated files (cuts.inc, run.inc)

- remove current param/run_card.inc generation from export_ME7.py and create a 'treatcards' python file
  in Template/TorinoNLO/bin to be called before the integration in the makefile, as
                ../bin/treatcards treatcards all
  so as to always have their updated version;

- add libraries compilation in the makefile

- add symlink for *_spin_correlation in the include directory

- create the new TorinoNLO template

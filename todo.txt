*********************
TODO 21/03

 - *done* create file.inc from exporter and sectors.py in an ‘include’ directory for each real subprocesses

 - *done* merge common files.f 

 - *done* define in nlo_Rsub the association iu,is,ib,ia = isec,jsec,iref,ia

 - add in makefile the command compiling the libdhelas/libmodel 

 - driver and nlo_Rsub need to know:  mur, scm, nit, ncall (read from card)

 - move common files.f in Source directory through exporter  

 - generalise makefile to all sectors

 - create makefile from exporter

*********************
28/03
- generation of param_card.inc and run_card.inc (still to be checked)
- modified math.inc: removed call to mur -> mu_r, asmz -> as, nloop (maybe) not set by param_card
- in driver and other file added: coupl/input/run/cuts.inc (*)
- added lines CALL SETPARA('param_card.dat'), CALL SETRUN('run_card.dat') in driver
- added sCM in NLO_Rsub + various include files in (*)
- reduced run_card.inc parameter to include just ebeam so far
- still necessary to define vegas parameters nitr,nclr (handled in launch phase in python)
- nloop set harcoded in math.inc
- added setrun.f in subprocess directory 

*********************
TODO Meeting 29/03

- import in Template/TorinoNLO the run_card.dat from NLO template, cuts.inc

- copy in Template/TorinoNLO/ the setrun.f version of test_eejj/Source (with necessary commented lines)

- remove current param/run_card.inc generation from export_ME7.py and create a 'treatcards' python file
  in Template/TorinoNLO/bin to be called before the integration in the makefile, as 
  		../bin/treatcards treatcards all  
  so as to always have their updated version;

- check that setrun.f and all include files from Source are removed from P_blabla/include directory; 

- modify makefile in Source to create libgeneric; create symlink for libgeneric to test_eejj/lib at the exporter level;
  (maybe also for libpdf.a);

- modify tmp_fortran/tmp_files/makefile to test_eejj version

- update templates for driver/NLO_Rsub/NLO_IR_limits to test_eejj version



*********************
TODO 30/03

- *fixed* fix writing of makefile in sectors.py (it seems to import the same for every subprocess directory!)

- *fixed* take care of changes in Source/makefile and setrun.f for generating libgeneric in Source (working one in test_eejj)

- *fixed* import in Template/TorinoNLO the run_card.dat from NLO template and associated files (cuts.inc, run.inc)

- *fixed* remove current param/run_card.inc generation from export_ME7.py and create a 'treatcards' python file
  in Template/TorinoNLO/bin to be called before the integration in the makefile, as
                ../bin/treatcards treatcards all
  so as to always have their updated version;

- *fixed* add libraries compilation in the makefile

- *fixed* add symlink for *_spin_correlation in the include directory

- *fixed* create the new TorinoNLO template


*********************
TODO 03/04

- two run_cards are generated (ME7 for MadNkLO dependences, NLO for run_card.inc): choose one (Maybe this is not a real issue)

- proc_characteristic: now generated in bin/treatcards but just with default values! Adapt to process.

- *fixed* link to makefile, coupl.inc in export_v4.py: removing the symlinks we have makefile just in NLO_RxR directories; 
  launch command doesn't work for LO for example

- *fixed* fix get_kkblo and geet_ccblo double definition in subprocesses featuring more than one Born matrix: add proc_prefix in 
  NLO_IR_limits_template and matrix_standalone_splitOrders template.



*********************
TODO 05/04

- Check normalizations for the real and the counterterms: we need this info in order to check the correctness of
our results with previous run on madnklo;

- Check how to extract the infos of the proc_characteristic to write run_card and param_card


*********************
TODO 06/04

- *done* Check the creation of the link to the Born matrix element (proc_prefix) for
the command line e+ e- > a > j j;

- Check the GevtoPb and 1/2/sCM prefactors;

- Check cancelation at NLO;

- *done* Implementation of the dotechcut function for avoiding NaN configurations;

- *done* Initialization of variables to 0 like ZNLO (Be sure that all the variables are set to 0 at the first time);

- Implementation of a function to test the cancelation of the IR limits


**********************
TODO 07/04

- Check the call to the HC functions (look at the X);
- Keep trace of the ierr and restore all of them;
- Check sectors.f for the implementation of the sectors functions;
- Check signs and normalization of Soft sector functions (look at the CCBLO);


**********************
TODO 12/04


- *done* obj-gfortran directory needs to be created at the makefile level


**********************
TODO 14/04

- Check the makefile issue (we do not want a full compilation even if one changes just one file);
- To write a driver for the LO process;
- Check the cancellation issue for a process with electroweak contributions;
- Compare the result from the Born integration with the ones from Paolo's code





- write in export_v4 info about Born PDGs in tmp file
- write function get_virtual_recoiler in sectors.py (with tmp_file)
- write include file with virtual recoilers in Real and Virtual dir
- check in imap.f, in get_collinear_mapped_labels, the recoiler flavour
- 


TODO 12/05

- generalise NLO_I.f in virtual directory, to read the correct leg_Born_PDGs include file
- test on ee>3j (phase space)
- cut on pt (import docut function)
- 



**********************
TODO 23/06

- read MU_R from run_card.inc and not from param_card.inc
- find out why the code stops running changing MU_R value to 3.50000e+01
- copy a directory containing common files (as cuts.f, analysis.f, ...) in every process directory during output
- fix 'make' command in virtual directory
- check plots
- remove prints from aloha
- DHELAS libraries (ask Marco)
